Thousands of images of brutalist buildings have been shown to a neural network and the aim of this was to reproduce the objects that appeared in these images. At the end of a learning process, the network ends up extracting visual characteristics that occur in the different images and generating images composing these particularities, but it does not do so in a way that represents the meaning of what a building means.

Human perception understands the geometric and structural meaning from a photograph, even more explicit in this type of buildings, but the perception of the machine in its mathematical sense lacks that context that allows to accommodate the visual characteristics within a larger map in the one with previous experience.

What is shown are some results (out of the thousands) generated in which the understanding on the part of the machine of the texture, composition and form of what is represented in the photographs is appreciated, but perhaps not of the most characteristic characteristics. that make the building what it is.
