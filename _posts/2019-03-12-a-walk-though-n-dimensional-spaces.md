Neural networks generally operate with mathematical objects called tensors. These are the extension of a matrix to more dimensions. A matrix (or tensor of order 2) is a two-dimensional grid in which each position is a number. A tensor of order 3 would represent a cube of numbers.

What is represented here is about 40x40x7 cubes generated by a randomly initialized neural network and mapped to a two-dimensional image. The 7 numbers of the third coordinate contain the information about the exterior color (3 numbers that encode an RGB color), the interior color (three other numbers) and the size of the interior square with respect to the exterior (the seventh number).

This mapping is arbitrary and not unambiguous, but it allows to project 7 dimensions on a two-dimensional plane.
The different pieces together could be considered a tensor of order 4.
